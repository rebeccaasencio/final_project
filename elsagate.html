    <h2 id="creepyElsa1">What is Elsagate?</h2>
    <p id="whatIsElsagate">Elsagate is a phenomenon referring to the controversy surrounding inappropriate videos on Youtube and Youtube Kids that were categorized as “kids content”. These videos depicted violence, sexual situations, fetishes and injections, etc. featuring popular characters like Elsa, Spiderman, The Joker, and The Hulk, etc.<br>
Webs & Tiaras and Toy Freaks were the two most notable channels creating this content.
Once these Elsagate videos started to gain popularity and views, it was clear that this emerging kid's content industry was a money maker.

    <h2 id="creepyElsa1">Youtube's Response:</h2>
    <p id="youtubeResponse">As Elsagate videos gained popularity, the Youtube algorithm rewarded these videos with clicks and ad revenue. Youtube’s lack of action motivated these channels to create even more disturbing videos featuring scat content (poop fetish).<br>
In 2017, articles and large voices on Youtube started calling attention to Elsagate videos, highlighting the disturbing nature of its content. Conspiracy theories of these videos were surfacing that the creators of these videos were pedophiles who wanted to groom children into liking the disturbing themes in the videos, meanwhile, Youtube was still allowing the content to spread on its platform.
Youtube’s first response stated that the algorithm on Youtube Kids determined if the content is appropriate for “child-friendly” videos. Youtube also stated that “Parents are in the front seat”--taking almost no reponsibility. But clearly, Youtube’s algorithm were letting these disturbing videos slide.<br>Youtube then decided to change its policy, stating that any content that depicted family entertainment characters in an inappropriate way would not be eligible for monetization. This seemed like a good effort from Youtube at the time, but the policy wasn’t properly enforced.
Once Ebay, Amazon, Adidas, and other brands were pulling ads from the platform in response to the disturbing kid's content featured on Youtube’s platform, Youtube took the situation seriously.
On November 28th, 2017, Youtube terminated 250 Elsagate channels, removed 150,000 offending videos, shadowbanned 625,000 videos, and allocated 10,000 human reviewers to audit videos.

<h2 id="creepyElsa1">Aftermath:</h2>
<p id="aftermath">
  Elsagate videos aren’t completely gone, but they do not get as many views as they did before. Elsagate is no longer a money-making industry on Youtube.<br>
  Youtube violated children’s privacy laws and got sued by the FTC for 170 million dollars. Youtube was illegally collecting and tracking the viewing history of minors to facilitate targeted advertising.
  This caused Youtube to demonetize and disable comments on kids' channels in late 2019. <br>While it's unclear why the FTC wanted to investigate Youtube's child safety compliance, Elsagate was a big contributing factor.
